4. Enhancing Vendor Behavior Using Polymorphism
   Task: Add FastVendor and SlowVendor classes with different ticket release rates.
   Solution:
   Create FastVendor (double rate) and SlowVendor (half rate) classes inheriting from Vendor.
   Use polymorphism to seamlessly integrate these into the system.
   Test Case: Run both vendor types concurrently and ensure their rates differ as expected.
